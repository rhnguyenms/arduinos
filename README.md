**Self Distributive Adaptive Systems (SDAS)**

**Overview**

The SDAS, an exceptional project that illustrates Networked Computing in a Physical Environment with Interconnected Arduino devices. These devices automatically transmit information on data and security displaying network behavior of decentralized choice making and dynamic adaptation.

**Features**

Distributed Computing: A network brought together by several Arduinos.

Autonomous Communication: Devices independently transmit and receive data.

Dynamic Adaptation: This leads to real-time data processing and response as the network changes.

Security Focused: It focuses on secure communication over the network.
